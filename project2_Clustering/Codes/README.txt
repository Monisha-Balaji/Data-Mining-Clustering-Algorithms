README

Install python 3.7.4 version, pandas and itertools

Run the submitted python file in Command prompt. Keep the files new _dataset_1.txt, new_dataset_2.txt, GMM_tab_seperated.txt, dbscan_tab_seperated.txt in the same folder as the python files in order to avoid giving full path when prompted for filename.
